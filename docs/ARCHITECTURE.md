# Segel — Architecture

Three layers: **off-chain ZK** (circuits + in-browser proving), **on-chain**
(Soroban desk + two BN254 Groth16 verifiers), and **the client** (landing + desk
UI that proves in the browser and signs real transactions).

## Circuits (Groth16 / BN254)

### bidValidity (8 public inputs)
`[commit, bandMin, bandMax, availBal, bidder, aspRoot, rfqId, nullifier]`

Private: `bid, nonce, idSecret, pathElements[10], leafIndex`. Constraints:
- `commit == Poseidon(bid, nonce, bidder)` — commitment binding
- `bid` is 64-bit; `bandMin ≤ bid ≤ bandMax` — in-band
- `bid ≤ availBal` — proof-of-funds (availBal pinned to the escrow = `band_max`)
- `Poseidon(idSecret)` ∈ Merkle(`aspRoot`) — allow-list membership, identity hidden
- `nullifier == Poseidon(idSecret, rfqId)` — one bid per identity per RFQ

### auctionResult (19 public inputs, N=8 slots)
`[rfqId, winnerAddr, clearingPrice, commit[8], bidder[8]]`

Private: `bid[8], nonce[8], winnerIdx, runnerIdx`. Constraints:
- each `commit[i] == Poseidon(bid[i], nonce[i], bidder[i])` — binds the proof to
  exactly the on-chain commitments
- `winnerBid = bid[winnerIdx]`; `winnerBid ≥ bid[i]` ∀i — winner is the maximum
- mask out the winner, prove `runnerBid` is the max of the rest, and
  `clearingPrice == runnerBid` — **Vickrey second-price**, fully in-circuit
- `winnerAddr == bidder[winnerIdx]` — contract learns who to pay, nothing else

Empty slots are padded with `bid=0, nonce=0, bidder=0` → `commit = Poseidon(0,0,0)`.
The contract pads the recorded commitments identically before verifying.

## On-chain (contracts/otc)

`post_rfq` / `post_rfq_dvp` (also escrow a sell-side **base lot** — a 2nd SAC, e.g.
native XLM) → `commit_bid` (verify bidValidity, lock escrow, record commit +
nullifier) → `settle` (verify auctionResult, pay winner's clearing to maker, deliver
the base lot to the winner — **DvP** — refund surplus + losers) / `cancel_expired`
(refund all + return the lot to the maker). Upgradeable in place (`upgrade`) — the id
never changes.

**Two-asset DvP.** `settle` delivers the escrowed lot to the winner atomically with
the payment; `cancel_expired` returns it to the maker. The base asset must differ
from the quote token (enforced). Delivery is non-reverting: a winner who can't
receive is credited a base-claimable (`claim_base`), so it never bricks settlement.
(The DvP lot is passed as one `BaseSpec {token, amount, symbol}` so `post_rfq_dvp`
stays within Soroban's 10-argument cap once `taker` is added.)

**Directed Direct OTC.** `post_rfq_dvp` takes an optional `taker`: if set, only that
address may bid (`commit_bid` rejects anyone else, Error #15); absent = open to
anyone. `taker(rfq_id)` view. Makes Direct OTC a real bilateral trade.

**Un-griefable refunds.** Loser refunds use a non-reverting transfer; a failed one is
credited as `claimable` (pulled via `claim`) rather than reverting the whole batch.
Status is written before any transfer (checks-effects-interactions).

**Oracle price-guard.** When the admin arms `set_price_guard(bps)`, `settle` reads
the live Reflector mark and rejects a clearing outside ±bps of the lot's market value
(`mark_price(base) × base_amount`). A fat-finger / honest-misconfig circuit-breaker —
**not** an adversarial control (the maker supplies the band + symbol); the
auctionResult proof remains the real binding on `clearing`. Fails open (skips, never
bricks) on no feed / zero price / overflow.

**Binding.** For each proof the contract builds the public-input `Vec<Bn254Fr>`
itself, in circuit order, from values it controls — the authenticated bidder
(`addr_field(from)`), the RFQ band, the recorded commitments. It never trusts a
caller-supplied input vector, so a valid proof can't be replayed with a different
bid / identity / bid-set.

`field encodings`: integers → 32-byte big-endian → `Bn254Fr::from_bytes` (reduces
mod r). `addr_field` = `keccak256(addr ScVal XDR) mod r`, matched bit-for-bit by
`stellar.js` in the browser.

## Client

- `prover.js` — Poseidon (circomlibjs) + snarkjs `groth16.fullProve` for both
  circuits; converts proofs to Soroban args (G2 c1‖c0 ordering).
- `stellar.js` — RPC reads (rfqs incl. base legs, bids, balances, mark_price,
  poseidon_hash; reads fan out in parallel) + signed writes via `@stellar/stellar-sdk`
  (Freighter or embedded demo key); USDC↔stroops scaling at the edge.
- `app.js` — the desk UI (vanilla, faithful to the Claude Design source).

Bid amounts are computed and proved entirely client-side; only commitments and
proofs go on-chain.

## MCP server (mcp/server.mjs)

A Stellar-native, **read-only** Model Context Protocol server so any AI agent can
query the live desk without wiring Soroban RPC: `list_rfqs`, `bid_count`,
`clearing_price`, `read_settlement` (reads the outcome the on-chain verifier already
accepted — it does not re-run the proof), and `mark_price` (live Reflector mark).
Every tool is a real on-chain simulate; there is no signing path.
